# Arduino-Voice-Recognition-Project-2.0
Multiple motors + Arduino Nano + Speech Recognizer


Here, I want multiple motors move simultaneously on a specific voice command.

Needs a separate power source, such a batterly holder with max 6v power, that solely powers motors. Sppech Recognizer MUST BE powered from a separate source.
In my case, I use a 3.3v pin on Arduino Nano.

Motors simultaneously move on commands "Start" and "Stop".
